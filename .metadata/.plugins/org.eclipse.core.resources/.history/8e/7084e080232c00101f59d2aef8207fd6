---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6/25/07 - v1.0
 -Totally redid ButtonMaps to allow multiple types of actions (key presses, mouse
    clicks, and mouse scrolls) to coexist.
 -ButtonMap subclasses still exist, but now serve only to provide convenience
    constructors. They have no additional or specialized functionality.
 -ButtonMaps can also now require buttons to be pressed on both the remote and a
    peripheral to trigger.
 -Added isAnyPressed and isOnlyPressed as button evaluation methods.
 -By default, no lights turn on when the remote is connected (all four lights used to turn
    on). You should turn on at least one light so that users know the remote is on.
 -Got my hands on and tested a classic controller. There were bugs. They are fixed.
 -Changed left and right triggers on the classic controller to percents instead of values.
 -Fixed a lot of bugs.
 -Improved IRAccelerometerMouse to be more reliable when the mouse is being
    moved around (there is some acceleration). It's not where I want it yet, but it's better.
