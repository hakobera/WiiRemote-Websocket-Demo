SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR WIIREMOTEJ

PLEASE READ THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (“LICENSE”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE.  BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE, REMOVE IT FROM YOUR COMPUTER, AND CEASE TO DISTRIBUTE IT IN ANY FORM.

1. General.  The software (WiiRemoteJ.jar and the files it contains), tools, utilities, sample or example code, documentation, and other materials accompanying WiiRemoteJ, including this license (collectively, the “Library”), are licensed to you by Michael Diamond (the "Author"). You own the media on which the Library is recorded, but the Author retains ownership of the Library itself. The terms of this license will govern any updates to the Library unless such an update is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern. If this license is included as part of a separate piece of software that makes use of the Library, then this license does not necessarily apply to that software or its accompanying documents.

2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.  
A.  You may use the Library to: (i) test the Library; (ii) run software requiring the Library; and (iii) develop software using the Library. 

B. You may make as many copies of the Library as you wish, and you may distribute the copies to whomever you wish, provided that: (i) you distribute the Library in full, without modification, including all original documentation, Sample Code, licenses (including this document), etc. as were initially present in the Library, (ii) you reproduce with each copy of the Library, all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original, (iii) if you offer the Library through any sort of digital means (the internet, peer-to-peer services, etc.), you distribute it free of charge, (iv) if you offer the Library through any sort of physical media (CD-ROM, DVD, etc), you charge no more than US $10 for this service (this $10 includes any shipping and handling charges you impose).

C.  Some sample or example code ("Sample Code") is provided by the Author with the Library. You may use, reproduce, modify and redistribute such Sample Code with one restriction: if you modify the Sample Code in any way, you must remove the Author's name from the code. SampleCode is the only portion of the Library that may be distributed as a standalone item. If you redistribute such Sample Code in an unmodified form along with the Library, then the terms and conditions for distributing the Library in section 2.B will apply. If you modify the Sample Code and distribute it with the Library, then it ceases to be Sample Code and becomes a Work, as defined in section 2.D and is therefore governed by that section.

D. You may create software that uses the Library (a "Work") and distribute this software for free or for charge, so long as the conditions in this subsection are met. Note that a Work is defined as an application, utility, library, or any other type of software that accesses the software part of the Library (directly or indirectly) at any point during its execution. Note that Works may not under any circumstances alter the Library in any way. There are no restrictions for distributing Works without the Library (such Works would require users to obtain the Library on their own). Works that include the Library or any portion thereof, however, must meet the following conditions for distribution: (i) the software portion of the Library included with the Work must be complete and unmodified, though the Work need not include any other portion of the Library); if any other portion of the Library is included, it must be unmodified, (ii) you must clearly indicate in a prominent location (for instance, in a README) that the Library is separate from the Work and that it is free for use pursuant to the terms of this License (you must link to the Library or to this License, or you must include this License with your Work, though it need not apply to any code you write as part of the Work).

E.  Except as and only to the extent expressly permitted by this License and by applicable law, you may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, modify, or create derivative works of the Library or any portion thereof.

3. Termination.  This License is effective until terminated.  Your rights under this License will terminate automatically without notice from the Author if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Library and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Library.

4. Disclaimer of Warranties. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LIBRARY IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LIBRARY IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND THE AUTHOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LIBRARY, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

5. Limitation of Liability. THE AUTHOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY AND EVEN IF THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6. Complete Agreement.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the Library licensed hereunder and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding such subject matter.  No amendment to or modification of this License will be binding unless in writing and signed by the Author.
